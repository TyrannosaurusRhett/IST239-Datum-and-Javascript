			I’ve lived most of my life in South Carolina. It’s not that I’m so enamored with the state that I refuse to ever leave it, but it’s just where my family’s resided pretty much ever since the first Rhetts arrived from England. I have three brothers. One of them is older, and two are younger. They are step-brothers, but we were friends as kid and grew up together, so it wasn’t really a big change when my mom and their dad remarried and made it official. I also have two step-sisters through my dad’s second marriage, but I’ve never actually met them. One of them lives out in Colorado, and the other one resides in Pennsylvania. I’m sure they’re decent people, but I’m not jumping at the chance to meet them. They’re off living their lives, and I’m here doing the same thing in my own way.<br>

			My time in grade school was challenging. I had undiagnosed ADHD, my interests didn’t tend to fall in line with what was popular, and I was socially awkward. It led to middling at best grades and feeling pretty isolated from my peers. College was better for me in a social sense, but my grades still were not great. The ADHD didn’t help, but it wasn’t the only issue at the time. Still, I managed to scrape by and graduate. Unfortunately, a history degree is not the easiest thing to transfer into a job, so I decided to come back to school to learn web development.<br>

			When I’m not working either for my actual job or for class, I have many other activities that I do. If I’m feeling lazy, I’ll play video games. If I’m feeling more active, I’ll do things like leather working or jewelry making or miniature painting. These activities aren’t free to do though. Materials cost money, so I’ve been considering beginning to livestream crafting sessions to see if there’s anyone interested in watching me work and to maybe try to earn a little bit of money to help supplement my crafting habits. At the same time, I do worry that trying to monetize my hobbies might make them into something I don’t enjoy doing anymore, so there is some hesitation there. I’m also part of a weekly tabletop gaming group. I and five other people get together every week to play mostly Dungeons & Dragon, but sometimes we swap it out for different rule systems. Ever since covid hit we’ve been meeting virtually, but we’ve been playing together for nearly three years at this point.
